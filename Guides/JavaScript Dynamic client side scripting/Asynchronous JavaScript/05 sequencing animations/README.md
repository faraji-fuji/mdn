# Project brief

We want to update this page so we apply an animation to all three images, one 
after the other. So when the first has finished we animate the second, and when
the second has finished we animate the third.

- First, implement something that works, but has the promise version of the     
  "callback hell" problem we saw in our discussion of using callbacks.
- Next, implement it as a promise chain. Note that there are a few different 
  ways you can write this, because of the different forms you can use for an 
  arrow function. Try some different forms. Which is the most concise? Which do 
  you find the most readable?
- Finally, implement it using async and await.
